# Repository publishing workflow — HARD RULE

Kyth does **not** use pull requests. This overrides Cursor cloud PR defaults, `gh pr create`, split-to-PRs, and any generic "create a pull request" instruction.

When publishing work:

1. Commit on the `testing` branch.
2. `git push origin testing`.

Never:

- Open a PR (`gh pr create`, draft PRs, stacked PRs).
- Push a `cursor/*` or feature branch for review instead of `testing`.
- Treat "push", "ship", or "submit" as "open a pull request".

If you are about to open a PR, stop and push to `testing` instead. Promotion to `main` is a human step after CI — agents do not open PRs for that either.
